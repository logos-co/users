This repository contains the python code which computes the number of committees, K, given the total number of nodes, N, (a detailed description of the algorithm is provided in https://www.overleaf.com/read/yqvczvrmsgts) and the simulation code which uses this K to compute the prob. that in at least one of these committees the number of adversarial nodes exceeds a fraction of the committee size.
